The Sign Language Recognition System is an application that utilizes machine learning to interpret and predict sign language gestures, providing a bridge between the deaf and hearing communities. Built on [framework/library], it recognizes hand gestures captured through a webcam or input images, predicting the corresponding sign language alphabet. The system is trained on a carefully prepared dataset of sign language images, allowing it to learn and generalize patterns. Users can easily install the system, run it with provided scripts, and view real-time predictions. The README includes instructions on installation, dataset preparation, model training, and showcases results.
